## What is KateBattle?
 This project is my undergraduate project, the last project we engage ourselves in for college time.
 We build this game using cocos2dx engine. With the great support the engine provide and the great effort
 we have gave, this game comes out and we hope when it show up it also show off ~

```shell
mkdir KateBattle\cocos2d\external\chipmunk\prebuilt win32
cd win32
mkdir debug-lib
cp ../wp8/win32/* debug-lib/
```
